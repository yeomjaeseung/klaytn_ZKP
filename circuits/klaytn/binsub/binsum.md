# Overview
This BinSum component in Circom is designed to calculate the binary sum of ops operands, each having n bits. The main function of this component is to perform addition across multiple binary inputs and output the sum as a binary number with the correct number of bits to represent the sum.

## How does it work
The BinSum template operates by performing a bit-wise addition of the input operands, translating the binary representation directly into an integer sum, and then converting this sum back into a binary format. It ensures that all output bits are binary (0 or 1) and the total input sum equals the output sum.

# Input Structure
in[ops][n]: A two-dimensional array of binary signals, where ops is the number of operands and n is the number of bits per operand.
# Output Structure
out[nout]: An array of binary signals representing the sum of the input operands. nout is the number of bits in the output, calculated based on the maximum possible sum of the inputs.
# Internal Logic
Bit-width Calculation:

The nbits function calculates the necessary number of output bits (nout) to represent the maximum possible value of the sum of all input operands.
Linear Combination of Inputs:

A linear combination sums up the weighted inputs, where each bit's weight is a power of two (2^k), corresponding to its position.
Bit Extraction for Output:

The sum (lin) is then converted back into binary by extracting each bit through right-shifting and masking ((lin >> k) & 1).
Binary Constraint for Outputs:

Each output bit is constrained to be binary through the assertion out[k] * (out[k] - 1) === 0, ensuring that each bit is either 0 or 1.
Sum Validation:

The final constraint lin === lout ensures that the linear sum of the input bits, translated into decimal, matches the linear sum of the output bits, confirming the integrity of the summation process.

## Here's an example of how you could use the BinSum template in a Circom circuit:

'''
pragma circom 2.0.0;

function nbits(a) {
    var n = 1;
    var r = 0;
    while (n-1<a) {
        r++;
        n *= 2;
    }
    return r;
}

template BinSum(n, ops) {
    var nout = nbits((2**n -1)*ops);
    signal input in[ops][n];
    signal output out[nout];

    var lin = 0;
    var lout = 0;

    var k;
    var j;

    var e2;

    e2 = 1;
    for (k=0; k<n; k++) {
        for (j=0; j<ops; j++) {
            lin += in[j][k] * e2;
        }
        e2 = e2 + e2;
    }

    e2 = 1;
    for (k=0; k<nout; k++) {
        out[k] <-- (lin >> k) & 1;

        // Ensure out is binary
        out[k] * (out[k] - 1) === 0;

        lout += out[k] * e2;

        e2 = e2+e2;
    }

    // Ensure the sum
    lin === lout;
}

BinSum facilitates the addition of multiple binary numbers while ensuring the correctness and binary nature of the output. It is suitable for cryptographic computations where precise and error-free addition of binary values is crucial.
