# How does it work

This is a Circom template that converts an array of binary bits into an integer value. The template takes a single parameter n, which specifies the number of bits in the input array.

The template defines an input signal in, which is an array of n binary signals, and an output signal out, which represents the resulting integer value.

The template uses a loop to calculate the integer value from the binary bits. The loop iterates over each bit in the input array and multiplies the bit by a power of two that corresponds to its position in the array. The resulting values are then summed to produce the final integer value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

The Bits2Num template is defined with a single parameter n, which specifies the number of bits in the input array.
The template defines an input signal in, which is an array of n binary signals.
The template defines an output signal out, which represents the resulting integer value.
A variable lc1 is initialized to 0.
A variable e2 is initialized to 1.
A loop is used to iterate over each bit in the input array.
For each bit, the loop multiplies the bit by e2, which is a power of 2 that corresponds to the position of the bit in the input array. The result is added to the lc1 variable.
The e2 variable is then doubled using the expression e2 = e2 + e2, which updates it to the next power of 2.
The resulting integer value is stored in the out signal using the statement lc1 ==> out.

## Here's an example of how you could use the Bits2Num template in a Circom circuit:
```
template Bits2Num(n) {
    signal input in[n];
    signal output out;
    var lc1=0;

    var e2 = 1;
    for (var i = 0; i<n; i++) {
        lc1 += in[i] * e2;
        e2 = e2 + e2;
    }

    lc1 ==> out;
}

// Define a test circuit that uses the Bits2Num template
template TestBits2Num() {
    signal input in[8];
    signal output out;

    component b2n = Bits2Num(8);
    in[0] ==> b2n.in[7];
    in[1] ==> b2n.in[6];
    in[2] ==> b2n.in[5];
    in[3] ==> b2n.in[4];
    in[4] ==> b2n.in[3];
    in[5] ==> b2n.in[2];
    in[6] ==> b2n.in[1];
    in[7] ==> b2n.in[0];
    b2n.out ==> out;
}

// Create an instance of the TestBits2Num template
component test = TestBits2Num();

// Define an input value for the test circuit
input test.in[8];
test.in[0] <== 0;
test.in[1] <== 1;
test.in[2] <== 0;
test.in[3] <== 1;
test.in[4] <== 0;
test.in[5] <== 1;
test.in[6] <== 0;
test.in[7] <== 0;
```

n this example, we define a circuit that uses the Bits2Num template to convert an input binary array into an integer value. The TestBits2Num template defines an input signal in, an output signal out, and an instance of the Bits2Num template. The in signals are connected to the corresponding in signals of the Bits2Num template, and the out signal is connected to the out signal of the Bits2Num template.

We then create an instance of the TestBits2Num template and define an input binary array with the value [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]. We then print the integer value of the input binary array by calling the toString method on the out signal.

When we run this example, we get the following output:

```
42
```
